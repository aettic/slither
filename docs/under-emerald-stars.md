# Under Emerald Stars

Act 1 of Aetrynos takes place on the surface world. The player returns to their small hometown, visiting a friend at her farm.

Alys Astraniela is an astronomer, an alchemist, and the inheritor of her parents' farm. Though she has little interest in running the farm, her son Darreth always found it to be rewarding work. The two of them have lived happy lives on this quiet farmstead for many years. Alys frequently experimented with new magic, and recently uncovered something very strange, but promising. She has called you back to visit and to show you what she has discovered, but by the time you reach the farm, she and her son are nowhere to be found. The empty farmstead tells a tale, and through investigation, you may uncover what happened to them, and where they might have gone.

The entirety of Act 1 takes place on the farmstead, which is comprised of a variety of disconnected buildings dotting the countryside. A looming cornfield borders the land to the North, while the West and South are surrounded by thick tangles of trees. Along the Eastern side of this plot runs an old dirt road.
