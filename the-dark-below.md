# The Dark Below

Descending into the earth via the stone stairs in the corn maze, our player finds themselves in the pitch dark, stumbling around a system of caves, the sounds of trickling water in the distance, accompanied only by the occasional scurrying of tiny feet.

There are four layers of the Dark Below:

1. **The Caves**
   The topmost layer, natural caves, twisting and turning, untouched except for the foot prints and wear of armies of fae surfacing to torment the living.

2. **The Barracks**
   More refined and squared up, but still naturally shaped and rough looking. Contains several different distinct rooms that are used by the fae military.

3. **The Library**
   The guts of this area are actually accessory to the barracks, but the peripheral of it is made up of a sprawling library cut into the stone, intermixed with the buried bodies of the dead.

4. **The Prison**
   Much like the library's core facilities supporting the barracks, this layer's core facilities support the link between the upper floors and the Unseen City itself. The surrounding area is made up of a complex array of prison cells, beyond which is constructed an elaborate labyrinth.

After the final layer, the player ends up in a small 5th layer which serves as a portcullis to the Unseen City. It is not a full dungeon layer like the other four. At this point, the player can exit the Dark Below and enter the Unseen City.
